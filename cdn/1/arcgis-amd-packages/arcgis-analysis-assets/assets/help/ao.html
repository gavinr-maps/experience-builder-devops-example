            <p>This  tool allows you to predict values at new locations based on measurements found in a collection of points. The tool takes point data with values at each point and returns areas classified by predicted values. You can use this tool, for example, to predict rainfall levels across a watershed based on measurements taken at individual rain gauges.

            <p>Buffers are typically used to create areas that can be further analyzed using other  tools such as Overlay Layers. For example, if the question is &quot;What buildings are within one mile of the school?&quot;, the answer can be found by creating a one-mile buffer around the school and overlaying the buffer with the layer containing building footprints.  The end result is a layer of  those buildings within one mile of the school.
